<ol>
<li><b></u>It saves you time.</li></b></u> If you spend a lot of your time answering emails or social media queries, an FAQ can be a real timesaver. It can also help prevent costly and time-consuming returns in your online store. <br> <br><br>
<li><b></u>It brings new customers to your site.</li></b></u> Google’s goal is to deliver answers to questions. If you put your text in a Q&A format, you’re doing half the work already. Even better, if you have a good answer to a question, you might get featured in one of Google’s answer boxes or feature snippets, which will give you a big traffic boost.<br><br><br>
<li><b></u>It gains trust and displays that you get it:</li></b></u> A well-written FAQ page shows experience. You know what customers are thinking and you’ve already got an answer. It’s a great way to increase the trust and professionalism of your website. <br> <br><br>
